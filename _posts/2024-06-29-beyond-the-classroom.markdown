 I never thought much about college when I was younger. It was just something you were supposed to do after high school. But those years were a bigger deal than I realized at the time.

Looking back, those years were a series of small experiments. Some failed, others succeeded in ways I never anticipated. Each one taught me something, not just about the subject at hand, but about myself and the world around me.

This isn't a guide on how to "do" college right. If my experience taught me anything, it's that there's no one right way. Instead, this is a collection of observations and lessons learned, offered in the hope that they might be useful to someone who's about to start this journey.

## The Fresh Start

Remember that shy kid from high school? Well, in college, that could become history. College offers a rare opportunity to reset your personal narrative. Nobody knows if you were the class clown, the wallflower, or the overachiever back home.

I saw classmates who'd always been labeled as "geeks" discover a passion for theater. Others who'd never raised their hand in school became vocal participants in classes. 

This change isn't something that just happens to you; it's something you actively participate in. Every class you choose, every club you join, every late-night conversation you engage in – they're all part of it.


This isn't about becoming a whole new person, though. It's more like... becoming more you. You're not carrying all that baggage from school anymore, you're free to explore who you really are – or who you want to become.

## "Explore"

"Make sure to explore!" This was the most common advice I got from seniors.
It's the advice equivalent of being told to "have fun" at a party where you don't know anyone. Well-intentioned, but frustratingly vague.

For me, exploration became synonymous with stepping into the discomfort zone. It meant following my curiosity down unexpected rabbit holes, going beyond my declared major, and learning to say "yes" to new experiences.

Looking back, I realize that the vagueness of the "explore" advice was its strength. There was no one right way to do it. My path of exploration was uniquely mine, shaped by my interests, fears, and random chances.

It's easy to now see how it all fits together. But when you're in the middle of it, it often feels like you're just stumbling around. Make peace with it. That stumbling is how you find the interesting stuff.

## Why are you in college?

A few months into college, you might start wondering why you're there. You're learning a ton on your own — YouTube, side projects, just reading stuff. So what's the point of college, really?

I couldn't find the answer to this in my first year, but over time, I realized that I'm paying for the opportunity to be among a crowd of really smart people.

It's not obvious at first how much this matters. But it adds up. Every internship I got, every little freelance job, every cool opportunity - they all came from people I met at college. Sometimes it was a friend putting in a good word, or just chatting with a senior, or an alum giving me advice. These little things that seemed so small at the time? They ended up shaping my whole college experience.

> The most valuable lessons often happen outside the lecture hall. Your job is to show up and be open to them.


## Not Losing Interest

One of the most surprising things about my first year wasn't the hectic coursework or the newfound independence. It was watching a good chunk of my classmates lose interest in programming before we'd even scratched the surface because their first introduction to it was making calculators in C in college classrooms.


There's something soul-crushing about spending hours debugging semicolons, pointers, or struggling to understand abstract concepts when all you want to do is create something meaningful. It's far from the experience many of us imagined when we signed up for Computer Science.


Losing interest early isn't always about being uninterested in the subject. Sometimes, it's about not finding the right way to engage with it. And unfortunately, that realization often comes too late. Modern programming is incredibly diverse. It can be creative, analytical, or a blend of both. It can involve building beautiful interfaces or solving complex algorithmic puzzles.

So if you're in that first year, seek out coding projects that excite you. Look beyond your coursework to see how programming is being used in fields that interest you. Join coding clubs or hackathons where you can work on more engaging projects.

## Not everything you're doing needs to make sense

There's a certain pressure in college to have it all figured out. To have a clear plan, a defined path. While this has its merits, it shouldn't come at the cost of experimentation.

In my second year of college, a few friends and I started day trading. It was amidst the global lockdowns and virtual classes.

We would join meets, backtest strategies, and share observations. After months of doing this, we finally started making sense of a few things and developed some strategies that we thought could work. We did the math and quickly realized that with the capital we had, effective risk management wasn't possible and our chances of success were about as good as getting heads on a coin toss.

Instead of abandoning ship, we pivoted. Our new goal became finding ways to earn money to build the capital we needed. This shift led us to freelancing, which, ironically, ended up being far more lucrative than our trading ambitions.

Years later, some of us are into algo trading, while others have found substantial success continuing with freelancing.

We were naive enough to think we could compete against seasoned quant teams, but that naivety led us to valuable experiences in unexpected ways.



So, while it's good to have a plan, don't let it constrain you. Leave room for the illogical, the experimental, the things that don't quite make sense. You never know where they might lead you.

## Do some side hustle

One of the most transformative experiences you can have in college isn't listed in any course catalog: making your own money. It's not about getting rich quick.
It's about the shift in mindset that occurs when you start earning.

You're no longer solely dependent on your parents or financial aid for every expense. Want to buy a domain name for that side project? Host a website? Attend a conference? Pay for that mentorship? You can make these decisions independently.

Having some financial independence changes how you interact with the world. You become more proactive, more willing to take calculated risks. You begin to understand the value of your time and skills in a way that textbooks can't teach.
You begin to understand why everybody is always talking about opportunity costs.

Just don't forget to balance it with your studies. After all, you're still in college to learn.

PS. Ignore if you're ultra rich

## Is your CGPA important? 

A high CGPA might not be necessary for every career path, but it certainly makes life easier in college.
With a good CGPA, you get priority in mentor selections for projects, more flexibility in choosing courses, better on-campus shortlisting opportunities and perhaps most importantly it often buys you goodwill with faculty and administration.

If you run into trouble or need an exception made, a history of good performance can tip the scales in your favor. 

Don't be surprised if your CGPA is asked before your name if you ever run into any trouble.

The key is finding a CGPA balance that keeps opportunities available without sacrificing your overall college experience. 


## Internships

Internships have this funny way of either confirming your career path or throwing it into complete disarray. That frontend internship might make you realize you actually hate doing designs. Or that internship at a startup might inspire you to have your own startup.

I went into my first internship convinced I wanted to be a Data scientist. Two months later, I was fascinated by Backend engineering. It was confusing and a little scary, but ultimately, it helped me find a career path I'm truly passionate about.

Internships are your chance to test-drive a career, to make mistakes in a (somewhat) safe environment, and to start building the network that will support you throughout your professional life.

They're also a great reality check. You might discover that your dream job isn't so dreamy after all. Or you might stumble into a field you never considered and fall in love with it.

Either way, you'll come out of it with new skills, new connections, and probably a few good stories.

#### The Competition Explosion

Internships hunting used to be much simpler. Now, things have changed quite a lot. The competition for internships has increased tenfold, and the process has become much more intense.

These days, you'll find dedicated groups on every social media platform where internship opportunities are posted. The moment a new opening appears, hundreds of students rush to apply. It's incredibly fast-paced and overwhelming.

What used to be a manageable number of applicants for each position has turned into a flood.

Getting a referral also used to be a big deal. Now? It's almost become too easy. Reach out to company employees on LinkedIn with a decent profile, and – referral acquired. It's great that it's more accessible, but when everyone's special, no one is.

This increased competition means you need to be quicker, more prepared, and more strategic in your approach. It's not just about finding opportunities anymore - it's about standing out in a very crowded field.

#### Finding Your Own Alpha

Try to go off the beaten path. Maybe it's reaching out directly to the CEO of a startup on Twitter. Perhaps it's creating a project that solves a problem for a company you want to work for. Or it could be leveraging your unique background or network in a way no one else has thought of.

I landed my internship at Google through a cold email. It was a shot in the dark, but it worked.

The point is, find your own "alpha" – do something that sets you apart from the crowd. 

Finding internship or a job is easily going to be the most hectic time of your college. Sending 10s of requests every day, filling those long forms, always studying to be interview ready, juggling classes and academic work. It might even remind you of your JEE days. The pressure is real, and the competition is fierce and you'll hear "No" a lot but it only takes one yes to change the trajectory of your career.






## The Hidden Curriculum

Throughout all of this, there's a hidden curriculum at work. It's not listed anywhere, but it's arguably more important than any class you'll take.

You learn how to learn. How to think critically. How to communicate with a wide range of people. How to manage your time, adapt to new environments, balance multiple responsibilities, deal with stress and uncertainty.

These might not be listed on my transcript, but in many ways, they're the most practical things I'll take away from my college years.

> College also teaches you that time is relative. One minute in a boring lecture feels like an hour, while one hour before a deadline feels like a nanosecond.

## Wrapping Up

College wasn't exactly what I expected. It was harder in some ways and easier in others. I learned things I never thought I'd care about. I made friends I'll keep for life, and got torn apart from people I thought would always be there.

It's tempting to see college as a means to an end - a step towards a career, a degree, a future salary. But a lot of value lies in the journey itself. In the people you meet, the ideas you encounter, the habits you form, and the person you slowly become.

This journey wasn't a straight line, and it shouldn't be. Embrace those detours. They're often where the most interesting discoveries happen.



You enter college as a rough draft of yourself. That first year is when you really start the editing process. And like any good edit, it involves a lot of crossing out, rewriting, and moments where you stare blankly at the page wondering what comes next.

But that's the beauty of it. You're the author now. The story is yours to write.
